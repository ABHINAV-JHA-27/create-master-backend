# NPX Backend Project Setup

A command-line tool for quickly creating and setting up a Node.js and Express backend project with various functionalities.

## Features

-   **Node.js & Express**: Bootstraps a Node.js server with the Express framework, providing a robust foundation for building your backend.

-   **Middleware**: Includes essential middleware for request parsing, error handling, and CORS.

-   **Authentication**: Implements user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure endpoints.

-   **Database**: Integrates MongoDB as the database to store and manage your data.

-   **Image Service**: Sets up image handling capabilities using the popular `multer` middleware and file storage in the `uploads` directory.

-   **Email Service**: Configures an email service using Nodemailer for sending transactional emails.

## Usage

To create a new backend project with this tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

2. Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx create-master-backend my-backend-project
    ```
````

Replace `my-backend-project` with your desired project name.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure your project:

    - Choose the functionalities you want to include (e.g., authentication, database, image service, email service).
    - Provide database connection details.
    - Configure email service settings.

4. Start your Node.js server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Your backend project is now up and running. You can start building your application by adding routes, controllers, and more.
